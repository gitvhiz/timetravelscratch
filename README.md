# Time Travel: A CS50 Project in Scratch
This is a short game I made using Scratch as part of my CS50x assignment at Harvard University.

## Instructions
The project consists of an initial storyline and a game in the latter half.
1. Use only the left and right arrow keys to move the rocket once the game begins.
2. Use the up arrow key to shoot bullets at the space rocks. You win once you shoot 10 space rocks.

## Notes and Credits
This project was made in fulfilment of Problem Set 0 of the CS50x 2022 course. I would like to thank Prof David J Malan for delivering a wonderful lecture on the basics of Scratch which motivated me to do this project.
A huge thank you to Geek Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzPI8bZBZZIL5eftCCxEN1g) whose easy to follow guidelines helped me in partially developing the gamified section of my project.
